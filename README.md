## üìã About the Project

This project was developed as part of the **1DV613 Software Development Project** course at Linnaeus University, during the first year of the Web Developer program. The project and documentation were developed over **10 weeks** as a learning exercise in modern web development.

### What does Timelock do?

Timelock is a password manager that aims to give users control over their passwords. The system includes:

- **Secure password storage** - Passwords are encrypted and stored safely
- **Password history tracking** - See when passwords were changed (without revealing old passwords)
- **Email verification** - Two-step authentication for added security
- **Microservice architecture** - Separate services for different functions
- **User privacy focus** - Built with privacy as a core principle

*Note: End-to-end encryption is part of the project vision and will be implemented in future updates.*

### Technologies I learned and used

- **Frontend:** EJS templates, HTML/CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Security:** JWT tokens, cryptojs password hashing, CSRF protection
- **Tools:** Docker for containerization, Nginx, Google OAuth2
- **Testing:** Vitest for unit testing, manual testing

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Timelock is built with three separate services:

- **Frontend-app:** Handles the user interface and web pages
- **Auth-service:** Manages user accounts and login
- **Password-service:** Stores and manages password data

## Installation

### What you need
- Node.js (version 14 or newer)
- MongoDB
- Docker (optional but recommended)

### Quick start with Docker
```bash
# Download the code
git clone https://github.com/BackEndByAlex/Timelock.git
cd Timelock

# Start everything with Docker
docker-compose up -d
```

### Manual setup
```bash
# Download the code
git clone https://github.com/BackEndByAlex/Timelock.git
cd Timelock

# Install packages for each part
cd frontend-app && npm install
cd ../auth-service && npm install  
cd ../password-service && npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Start the application
npm run dev
```

## Current Features

- User registration and login
- Email verification with codes
- Google sign-in option
- Password storage with encryption
- Password change history (timestamps only)
- Automatic logout after being inactive
- Protection against common web attacks
- Works on mobile and desktop
- Basic password generation

## üîí Security Features I Implemented

- **JWT authentication** - Secure login tokens
- **Password hashing** - Passwords are never stored in plain text
- **Data encryption** - User data is encrypted in the database
- **Request protection** - CORS and CSRF security measures
- **Rate limiting** - Prevents spam and brute force attacks
- **Input checking** - Validates all user input
- **Session timeouts** - Automatic logout for security

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test:unit

# Test individual services
cd auth-service && npm test:unit
cd password-service && npm test:unit
```

## What I Learned

Building Timelock taught me:

- **How to structure large applications** with multiple services
- **Web security basics** and how to protect user data
- **Authentication systems** and session management
- **Using Docker** to manage development environments
- **API design** and how services communicate
- **Writing tests** to ensure code works correctly
- **Deployment processes** and CI/CD basics
- **Project planning** and working with iterations

### Development Practices I Used
- ESLint for code quality
- Prettier for consistent formatting
- Consistent naming conventions
- Git for version control with meaningful commits
